    "# Exploration of the Construction of Liquid Fuel Bipropellant Rocket Engines Utilizing Additive Manufacturing Processes\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Abstract:\n",
    "\n",
    "The Portland State Aerospace Society (PSAS) is an engineering student group and citizen science project at Portland State University dedicated to building low-cost, open-source, open-hardware rockets and avionics systems. The groupâ€™s stated long term goal is to place a 1 kg cubesat into low Earth orbit with their own launch vehicle. One step needed to achieve this goal is to transition the current rocket design from a solid motor to a liquid fuel engine. The liquid propelled rocket engine project is being conducted as part of a mechanical engineering senior capstone project at Portland State University. This project is on track to being completed by June of 2016.\n",
    "\n",
    "The complexity and cost of building a liquid fuel rocket engine typically makes such devices unobtainable for a majority of parties interested in their construction. Until recently, manufacturing processes and techniques limited the geometries available to the designer and rendered such engines cost prohibitive as options for inexpensive orbital space flight. Advances in additive manufacturing technologies provide the potential to prototype complex geometries on a lower budget and with shorter lead times which would be considered unobtainable with traditional manufacturing methods. Furthermore, bipropellant liquid fuels offer many complex engineering considerations; the full analysis of which may not be within the design ability of many amateur builds. It is therefore advantageous to develop techniques for additive manufacturing rapid prototyping to make the study of bipropellant fuels more accessible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Explored herein is the process of designing and testing a liquid bipropellant engine on the scale of 50-1000 lbf of thrust using liquid oxygen (LOX) and ethanol as propellants. A low cost pintle injector and accompanying regeneratively cooled thrust chamber is developed using a combination of traditional manufacturing techniques and additive processes. Equations have been determined to describe the more complex geometries of the nozzle contour and the sizing of other important components. Figure 1 shows the preliminary design of the combustion chamber and nozzle with cooling channels. Heat transfer analysis is being conducted to determine the type of metal to be selected for the nozzle and cooling chamber, most likely a high-temperature steel such as inconel.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 1: Combustion chamber and nozzle preliminary design\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to achieve a simple and easy to manufacture pintle injector design, the regenerative cooling channel interface, fuel manifold and most of the injector plate will be part of the additively manufactured combustion chamber. The design will accommodate easy installation of different injector types to allow for testing of different injector and spray configurations. Cold flow tests will be conducted to study the viscous losses in 3D-printed metal cooling channels, manifold system, and pintle injector designs.\n",
    "\n",
    "An engine test-stand has been constructed and a pressure fed fuel system with actuated valves is being developed for fuel delivery. Pressure transducers and thermocouples will be ported into the final engine design to collect pressure and temperature data in the nozzle and combustion chamber. Analytical solutions and empirical data will be compared against simulations carried out by computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations. CFD simulations will be conducted using Loci/CHEM and Star-CCM+ simulation software."

    "#### Initial Design Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "Parameters must be selected. The generation of force is the desire of a rocket engine. the force equation is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F = \\frac{\\dot{w}}{g} V_{e} + A_{e}(P_{e}-P_{a}) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is important when designing engines for flight, but when testing engines $P_{e}$ is optimally expanded and assumed to be atmospheric pressure (14.7 psia) and the equation becomes:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F = \\frac{\\dot{w}}{g} V_{e} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "For engines in flight the effective exhaust velocity, $c$, can be used, and equation X can be expressed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$F = c\\frac{\\dot{W}}{g} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where c is defined as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$c=V_{e} + A_{e}(P_{e}-P_{a})\\frac{g}{\\dot{W}} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "which changes with altitude.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a desired force, there must then be selected an exit velocity to find the necessary flow rate, $\\dot{w}$. The theoretical exit velocity is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$V_{e} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2g\\gamma}{\\gamma-1}RT_{i}\\bigg[1-\\bigg(\\frac{P_{e}}{P_{i}}\\bigg)\\bigg]^\\frac{\\gamma-1}{\\gamma}+v_{i}^2} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the inlet velocity is very small, it is assumed to be zero, this gives the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$V_{e} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2g\\gamma}{\\gamma-1}R(T_{c})_{ns}\\bigg[1-\\bigg(\\frac{P_{e}}{(P_{c})_{ns}}\\bigg)\\bigg]^\\frac{\\gamma-1}{\\gamma}} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "which is dependent on the propellants and chamber pressure which should be chosen for the design, $P_{i}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Flame temperature and gamma can be obtained for a given propellant combination by using NASA's [CEArun](https://cearun.grc.nasa.gov/) tool. [link to portion in document which describes how to use cearun](internallinkhere)\n",
