# Overview
This model is an estimated replica of Copenhagen Suborbital's BPM2. The model's dimensions are rough estimates from visually guessing BPM2's size in videos. The simulations were conducted with Solidworks Flow Sim. Inlet boundary conditions were gaseous H2O, 3000K, 250psi, with varying mass flow rates. Outlet boundary condition was environmental opening at 14.7psi and 293.15K temperature.

### My findngs

From Rocket Propulsion Elements by Sutton, Chapter 3.2:
> Chamber velocity can only be neglected if Ac/At > 4, only if chamber cross sectional area is 4 times bigger than throat area.


I believe that the losses from a throatless engine come from the immediate pressure loss in the chamber which is why the gas in the chamber is already accelerated and not stagnant like a traditional rocket engine. The high gas velocity right at the injector may be a result of the pressure loss, due to chamber and lack of throat geometry, which is being converted to velocity.
