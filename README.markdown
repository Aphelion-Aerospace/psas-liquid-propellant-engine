# PSAS Liquid-Propellant Engine (LPE) Designs

## Overview

PSAS is building a LPE because (1) it's cool and (2) it's part of our 100 km rocket project. This project started with a 2015-2016 ME capstone of a 2kN 1/4 scale engine and is building towards a planned 6 kN flight enginer for LV4.

## Latest information

## Summer 2019 creation of the 500lbf heat sink engine

TBA

## 2018-2019 Test Stand Integration MME capstone
