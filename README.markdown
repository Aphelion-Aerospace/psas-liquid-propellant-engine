# PSAS Liquid-Propellant Engine (LPE) Designs

## Overview

PSAS is building a LPE because (1) it's cool and (2) it's part of our 100 km rocket project. This project started with a 2015-2016 ME capstone of a 2kN 1/4 scale engine and is building towards a planned 9 kN engine for the LV-4 vehicle.

## Latest information

## 2020-2021 creation of the 2kN heat sink engine

Regenerative cooling is hard, particularly when we don't know if the basic engine design is viable. For this reason (and because we already bought some expensive parts), we are moving back to a ~2kN preliminary design. In various documents, this engine may be referred to as:

* 2kN Heat Sink Engine
* Minimum Viable Produce (MVP) engine
* Test Stand Demonstration Engine

The engine is intended to fire for no more than several seconds on the PSAS test stand. The hope is this engine will provide validation for the rocket design, manufacturing learnings and provide experience with a full-up hot fire test.

## 2019-2020 Test Stand/Engine ME Capstone

Designed a 6kN heat sink engine... and then found out it was going to be too expensive to print and destroy this engine. Recommending moving back to 2kN for cost purposes.
